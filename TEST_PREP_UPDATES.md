### 2. **Exam Selection Screen**
- Beautiful card-based selection interface
- Each exam shows:
  - Specialty icon with color coding
  - Exam title and description
  - Number of questions
  - Hover effects and transitions
- Users can return to selection after completing an exam

---

### 3. **Randomization Features**

#### **Question Order Randomization**
- Questions are shuffled when an exam is selected
- Each user gets a different question sequence
- Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm

#### **Answer Option Randomization**
- Answer options are shuffled for each question
- Correct answer position tracked dynamically
- Prevents memorization of answer positions

#### **Implementation**
```typescript
// Shuffle function
const shuffleArray = <T,>(array: T[]): T[] => {
  const shuffled = [...array];
  for (let i = shuffled.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [shuffled[i], shuffled[j]] = [shuffled[j], shuffled[i]];
  }
  return shuffled;
};

// Questions and answers both shuffled on exam start
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedExam) {
    const baseQuestions = shuffleArray([...examConfig.questions]);
    const shuffled = baseQuestions.map(q => {
      const optionsWithIndex = q.options.map((opt, idx) => ({ opt, idx }));
      const shuffledOpts = shuffleArray(optionsWithIndex);
      return {
        ...q,
        shuffledOptions: shuffledOpts.map(o => o.opt),
        shuffledCorrectAnswer: shuffledOpts.findIndex(o => o.idx === q.correctAnswer)
      };
    });
    setShuffledQuestions(shuffled);
  }
}, [selectedExam]);
```

### 4. **Fixed Navigation Bug**
**Issue:** Clicking "Back to Hub" caused application error

**Root Cause:** The hub page requires authentication and was trying to access user data during static generation

**Solution:** 
- Navigation now works correctly from exam selection screen
- Navigation works correctly from exam in progress
- Navigation works correctly from completion screen
- Added "Change Exam" button to switch between exams without going back to hub

---

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**

#### **Exam Selection**
- Clear visual hierarchy with icons
- Color-coded specialties
- Question count displayed
- Smooth hover animations

#### **During Exam**
- Shows current exam title in header
- "Change Exam" button to switch tests
- Score tracking per exam
- Progress bar shows completion percentage

#### **After Completion**
- Results screen shows final score
- Accuracy percentage with visual bar
- "Choose Another Exam" button (restart with exam selection)
- "Back to Hub" button to return to dashboard

---

## Technical Implementation

### **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: number;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: number;
  explanation: string;
  category: string;
}

interface ShuffledQuestion extends Question {
  shuffledOptions: string[];
  shuffledCorrectAnswer: number;
}

type ExamType = 'general' | 'cardiology' | 'anesthesiology';
```

### **State Management**
- `selectedExam`: Tracks which exam is active
- `shuffledQuestions`: Stores randomized questions with shuffled answers
- `currentQuestion`: Current question index
- `selectedAnswer`: User's selected answer
- `showResult`: Whether to show answer feedback
- `score`: Total correct answers
- `answeredQuestions`: Array of completed question indices
